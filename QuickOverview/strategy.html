Texas Hold'em Poker Strategy
<!-- End Title -->

				</div>
				<div class="content">
<p>

</p><p>
To be a winning Texas Hold'Em player, there are several concepts that you should understand.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Position
</strong></p><p></p><p>
Position refers to your location at the table relative to the dealer.  If you are the dealer, you have the best position at the table because you are last to act during all but the preflop betting rounds.  Acting last is advantageous because you get to see what all your opponents do before you have to make a decision.
</p><p>
For example, you are on the button and two other players join you to see the flop.  The first player bets and the second player raises.  Because you have the best position, you get to make your decision with more information than you would if you had bad position (i.e. first to act).  Based on the actions of the other two players, you would know that at least one of these players probably has a strong hand, and you can make your decision accordingly.
</p><p>
This means that you should play more hands with good position than bad position.  For example, if you have A-8 and are first to act under the gun, you would fold because you have nine other players to contend with.  However, if you have A-8 on the button and everyone to your right folds, you can play this hand knowing that you will be facing only two other players.  Even better, you will have position on them for the duration of the hand if they decide to play.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Pot Odds
</strong></p><p></p><p>
Pot odds is the ratio of how much you stand to win in a hand vs. how much you must pay to continue.  For example, if the pot has $60 in it, and the bet you must call is $10, you are getting 6-to-1 pot odds.
</p><p>
Pot odds is important because it can often tell you whether you are getting the right price to call a bet.  Let's say you have 10-9 and the community cards show J-8-4-2.  You are facing an opponent that you believe has a pair of jacks.  If the river card is a Q or 7, you will make an unbeatable straight (a.k.a. the nut straight). There are four Qs and four 7s left in the deck of 44 unknown cards (52 total  2 hole cards  4 community cards  2 opponent hole cards = 44).  You can assume that your opponent doesnt have a Q or 7 in his hand.  You are a 36-to-8 underdog to make your straight, or 4.5-to-1.
</p><p>
If you take the previous example ($60 pot, $10 to call), you are getting 6-to-1 pot odds on a call.  Since you are only 4.5-to-1 to make your straight, the pot odds dictate that you should call.  However, if the pot only had $30 in it, you would fold because the 3-to-1 pot odds wouldn't be enough to compensate your 4.5-to-1 disadvantage.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Implied Pot Odds
</strong></p><p></p><p>
In addition to regular pot odds, sometimes you must add implied pot odds to your calculation.  Implied pot odds is the extra bets you might collect after you hit your hand.
</p><p>
Using the previous example, let's say the pot is $30.  Based purely on pot odds, you would fold.  However, if you believe that your opponent will put additional bets into the pot on the river after you hit your straight, that might make a call worthwhile.  If your opponent puts $15 of his money in the pot on the river, then your implied pot odds would be ($30+$15) / $10 = 4.5-to-1.  So if you think he will put more than $15 in the pot on the river, implied pot odds dictates that you should call the $10 on the turn.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Tells
</strong></p><p></p><p>
When playing Texas Hold'Em, it is important to observe your opponents and look for clues that might tell you what hole cards he or she might have.  Here are some different kinds of tells you can look for:
</p><p>
</p><p><strong></strong></p><ul><strong>
</strong><p></p><li>Physical: player sweating, hands shaking, rapid blinking, change in posture
</li><li>Vocal: player is unusually talkative (or quiet)
</li><li>Speed of play: player acts faster/slower than usual
</li><li>Betting: player changes his normal style, i.e. checks when he normally bets or vice versa.
<p><strong></strong></p></li></ul><strong>
</strong><p></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Aggressiveness
</strong></p><p></p><p>
The most successful Texas Hold'Em players have what is called a tight-aggressive style.  The tight means that you fold a high percentage of hands, whereas the aggressive means you put a lot of pressure on your opponents in the small percentage of hands that you do play.
</p><p>
When you play a hand aggressively, you are betting instead of calling.  By betting, you have two ways of winning the pot:
</p><p>
</p><ol><li>Your opponent(s) will fold.</li><li>You will showdown the best hand.</li></ol>  
<p>
When you are merely calling bets, you only have one way of winning: you must have the best hand.  
</p><p>
Betting gives you an additional way of winning, called fold equity.  For example, if you have a 40% chance of having the best hand after the river, but you believe your opponent will fold 50% of the time to a bet, your fold equity is 10%.  That is, you have a 10% better chance of winning the pot if you bet than if you call an opponent's bet.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Bluffing
</strong></p><p></p><p>
If you don't have a strong hand, you can still win the pot by pretending that you are strong.  Bluffing is an essential part of any poker game, and you cannot be a winning player if you never bluff.  Sometimes your bluffs won't work, but if you never bluff, your opponents will know exactly when to fold, call or raise against you.
</p><p>
Bluffing makes you unpredictable, which is a valuable image to have at the table.  If other players see you as unpredictable, it will make their decisions more difficult.  They won't know if you have a strong or weak hand.  They will be more likely to make mistakes against you, such as calling you with weaker hands or betting into you when you have a strong hand.  This will increase the size of the pots you win.
</p><p>
However, you can't bluff too often.  If players observe that you are betting too much, they will be more likely to look you up and call your bluffs.  Your bluffs must tell a story that is believable to you opponents, and if you are bluffing too often, the story won't add up.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Semi-Bluffing
</strong></p><p></p><p>
A great way to use bluffing is when you have a draw.  A draw is when you don't have a strong hand yet, but there is great potential for you to make a strong hand on the turn or river cards.  Bluffing with a draw is called a semi-bluff.
</p><p>
A great example of semi-bluffing is when you have an ace-high flush draw on the flop.  If you catch the fifth card of your suit, you will have a very strong hand.  This represents a great bluffing opportunity.  If you bet or raise the flop with the nut flush draw, you are semi-bluffing because you can win the pot in two ways: 
</p><p>
</p><ol><li>Your opponent(s) will fold.</li><li>You will make your flush on the turn or river.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Discipline, Patience and Focus
</strong></p><p></p><p>
Winning poker players have the following traits:
</p><p>
</p><ol><li>Discipline:  Winning players don't let emotions (positive or negative) affect their play.  If they win a big pot or get lucky, they don't get too high, and if they lose a pot or get unlucky, they don't get too low.  Discipline allows the winning player to play his best on every hand, no matter what happened in previous hands.
</li><li>Patience:  Winning players will wait for the right opportunities to win a pot, and not try to win every pot. They pick their spots, and if the time isn't right, they'll fold and wait until the time is right. 
</li><li>Focus:  Winning players pay attention at all times, even when they're not in the hand.  They study their opponents at the table, looking for patterns, tells and tendencies.  They will use this information later to their advantage.
</li></ol>
