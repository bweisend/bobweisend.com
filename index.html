				<div class='dialog-title'>WEB DEVELOPER</div>
				<p>My first experience with programming was in elementary school. My fifth-grade class visited a computer lab where we were taught the <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)'>Logo</a> programming language. I was fascinated that simple code could command the turtle to draw on the screen. I remember writing a program to get the turtle to draw a "circle" (not really... more like a 360-sided equilateral polygon) and how proud the teacher was that I figured it out.</p>
				<p>Then in middle school, my mom (a high school teacher) brought home an Apple IIe computer for the summer. I fell in love with the green monochrome screen and floppy discs. That summer I taught myself the <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC'>BASIC</a> programming language by looking at the code for the popular game <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game)'>Oregon Trail</a>. I even made my own "choose your own adventure" style game, which my parents loved!</p>
				<p>At Cal Poly, my programming skills took a giant leap as I learned advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, databases, object-oriented design, and memory allocation. I'll never forget having to write programs for Dr. Clint Staley, who would only accept it if the output matched his criteria <i>precisely</i>, even the whitespace!</p>
				<p>Today, my love of programming continues as a web developer:
				<ol>
					<li>I have built and maintained web applications for Fortune 500 companies such as HP, Symantec and Veritas (see my <a target='_blank' href='resume/Resume%20-%20Bob%20Weisend.pdf'>resume</a> for details).</li>
					<li>My most recent project at Hewlett Packard Enterprise was a LAMP stack application called <a target='_blank' href='netsrm/NETSRM%20SCREENSHOTS.pdf'>NetSRM</a>.</li>
					<li>Here's a <a target='_blank' href='speed/speed.html'>speedometer</a> I built as a take-home assignment for one of my recent job interviews.</li>
					<li>You can visit my <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/bweisend/sample-code'>GitHub</a> repository for code samples (including the source code for this website). </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Technology changes at light speed, and when you have a busy life like mine, it's hard to keep up with the latest advances. But some things never change... like the importance of creating awesome user experiences. There's nothing more rewarding than hearing a user/customer say "Wow! You've made my job so much easier!" It doesn't matter if your application uses the latest framework or a cutting-edge design. What matters is whether a) people like the application and are willing to use it, and b) the application solves a business problem.</p>

				<div class='dialog-title'>MANAGER</div>
				<p>While working as a web developer for HP, my manager left for another position, leaving his job vacant. After a few months with no replacement, I went to our director and asked whether he would consider me for the job. He told me that, coincidentally, he had been thinking about me for the role. Shortly thereafter, I was promoted to my first managerial position: Development Manager, Partner Systems.</p>
				<p>At the time I took the new role, the most common problem was communication between teams. This problem would manifest itself in many ways:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The quality assurance team didn't know what the new features were in an enhancement release.</li>
					<li>The stakeholders didn't know in a timely manner when a new release would be delayed.</li>
					<li>The production support team didn't get proper knowledge transfer for new releases, leaving them unprepared to fix bugs when they (inevitably) were reported by users.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>My team was split between the USA and India, so one of the changes I made was to institute frequent conference calls early in the morning or late at night. They were necessary to keep both groups working toward the same goals. I also kept in frequent contact with outside stakeholders in an attempt to close the communications gap between us.</p>
				<p>Overall, my 3-year stint as a manager was both rewarding and frustrating. As a manager, I was dependent on my team to deliver what we had promised, and it was not always easy to achieve. But my experience forged a perspective on management that I carry with me to this day.</p>
				<p><b>My management philosophy:</b></p>
				<ol>
				<li>Give your team the resources and support they need to do their jobs.</li>
				<li>Insist that breakdowns are reported early, and "don't shoot the messenger".</li>
				<li>Hold team members accountable, but only for things they can control.</li>
				<li>Some team members have great ideas but are hesitant to voice them. Be proactive in soliciting their feedback.</li>
				<li>Team members are not "resources". They are human beings and bring a complex array of unique life experiences to the team. Don't let these experiences go to waste.</li>
				<li>Bonding between team members is undervalued. But, with global teams being the standard these days, it is hard to forge strong bonds between members. As much as possible, allow teams to meet <i>in person</i>, at least once, to build and maintain these bonds.</li>

				<div class='dialog-title'>MY WEBSITE</div>
				<p>After I was laid off from HP in early 2016, I began my search for a new position. Web development had changed dramatically in the past few years, so to learn the new stuff, I watched dozens of webcasts on subjects including responsive design, single-page frameworks (i.e. Angular and React), JavaScript/ES6, CSS preprocessors, and more. I then put my newfound knowledge to work on my site. I tested on all the major browsers, as well as the primary devices (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone).</p>
				<p>As for the design, I wanted to do something unique. Most personal sites read like a resume. I wanted my site to be engaging, so my site mixes both the professional and the personal aspects of my life. For example, I have always loved video games, so I built a couple of games in JavaScript (both of which make it obvious that I grew up in the 80's!).</p>
				<p>Here are some of the technologies I incorporated into my site:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>HTML5 (&lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, &lt;input type='range'&gt;, local storage)</li>
					<li>CSS3 (media queries, responsive design, columns, border-radius, transition)</li>
					<li>LESS CSS preprocessor (variables, functions, mixins)</li>
					<li>JavaScript ES6 (let/const, arrow functions, promises, default parameters, spread operators, template strings)</li>
					<li>jQuery and jQuery UI (animations, event handling, drag and drop, browser compatibility)</li>

				<div class='dialog-title'>WHO AM I?</div>
				<p>Here are some interesting factoids about me:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>I am <b>married</b> to a woman who I frequently feel I don't deserve.</li>
				<li>I have two kids. Being a <b>father</b> is simultaneously the most rewarding and most annoying thing in my life.</li>
				<li>I have lost count, but I have been a <b>coach</b> for at least 15 sports teams for my kids. Sports include soccer, basketball, and softball.</li>
				<li>I enjoy <b>craft beer</b>. Anytime I travel, I make sure to find time to sample the local suds. I particularly enjoy barrel-aged beers, imperial stouts and barleywines.</li>
				<li>I discovered <b>electronic music</b> in college and have been a big fan since. Some of my all-time favorite artists include Orbital, Aphex Twin, Plaid, Autechre, Biosphere, Pete Namlook, Squarepusher, Luke Vibert, Boards of Canada, LTJ Bukem, and The Future Sound of London.</li>
				<li>I am an avid <b>poker</b> player. Every summer, I make a pilgrimage to the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and play in at least one event. The first time I went to the WSOP, I cashed in a $1,000 no-limit hold'em event, placing 141st out of 3,127!</li>
				<li>My family enjoys <b>camping</b> in my in-laws' 38-foot fifth wheel. It's more like "glamping" actually... the trailer has lots of amenities (flat screen TVs, microwave oven, shower, two bathrooms)</li>
				<li>I grew up in the Bay Area, so I root for all the <b>local sports</b> teams (49ers, Giants, A's, Sharks, Warriors, Stanford, Cal)</li>
				<li>I am a member of the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.phisigmakappa.org/'>Phi Sigma Kappa</a> fraternity. Damn Proud!</li>
				<li>I play <b>golf</b>. I'm good enough that I don't usually embarass myself on the course, but I'm no Jordan Spieth.</li>
				<li>A friend of mine started a website (QuickOverview.com), and he asked me to author a poker tutorial. Although the site isn't active anymore, you can view the archive <a target='_blank' href='QuickOverview/overview.html'>here</a>.
